# Quality control

drake issue: including images can be problematic. Since they are not located in the code chunks/inline code, there is no dependency being generated?

p-value QQ-plot:

![](results/qq.png)

Now do something with some data dependency.

```{r do-something}
somedata <- readd(somedata)

# do something with somedata
mean(somedata)
```


```{r iris, include = FALSE}
# ```{r iris}
plot(iris[,1:2])
```
